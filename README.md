## Getting started

This project is build for Expo GO, so you shouldn't need any native dependencies to run it.

First install all packages using `yarn`.

Then You can simply start the development server with:
`yarn start`

Then you can install the expo go app on your phone and scan the QR code to run the app.
Or press `a` to run it in an android emulator or `i` to run it in an ios simulator.

## Contributing
If you want to add an animation you can use a CLI that I made to generate the boilerplate code for you.
Run `yarn new` and follow the prompts. You can then modify the default animation to your liking.

Please don't "eject" the project as we want to keep it in the Expo Go scope for now to make it easy to run.
That means you can only use official Expo libraries and not any native dependencies. Also you can't use any
custom Expo plugins.
